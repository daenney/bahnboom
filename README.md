# Bahnboom

A CLI that reports current service disruptions and planned maintenance for
[Bahnhof](https://bahnhof.se).

Please note that since Bahnhof does not provide an API or RSS feed with
status information this CLI does some trickery to get it from the website.
Should Bahnhof change how they publish and retrieve the data, this CLI will
likely break.

## Build

Builds like any other Go project, with Go >= 1.16:

```
$ go build -o bahnboom
